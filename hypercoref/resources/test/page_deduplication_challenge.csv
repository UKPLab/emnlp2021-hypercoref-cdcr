But in a stark admission, Brown has revealed that the team's current MCL33 has a fundamental weakness which means it's not as strong a chassis as the MCL32 it replaced. Many believed that McLaren's switch from Honda to Renault power for 2018 – which sees them running the same power unit as Red Bull, three-time winners so far this season – would finally unlock the talents the team believed were hidden in their chassis, but which had been masked by a basic lack of grunt. Indeed, McLaren even predicted at the end of last season that they would outclass Red Bull at certain circuits on the calendar this year. The constructors' standings so far tell a different story, however, with McLaren holding just 48 points ahead of the German Grand Prix, compared to Red Bull's 199 – and Renault's 70, for that matter. Renault also hold the prized fourth place in the championship too, marking them as the highest performing midfield team, with McLaren down in seventh. So what's gone wrong? ""I'm not going to get too technical,"" said Brown, ""but we don't have the same level of downforce that we had last year. We have identified an area in which our car is weaker than last year's car. ""Did we have the best chassis last year? No, definitely not. Did we have probably a better chassis? I think because of all the different variables, it would be hard to definitively say yes or no, but we know we have less downforce this year than last year."""

That tussle ultimately lost the Dutchman the race, allowing Lewis Hamilton to regain the lead and secure victory for Mercedes. Ocon was handed a 10-second stop-go penalty as punishment for the on-track incident, while Verstappen will be required to take part in two days of 'public service' at the direction of the FIA following the pushing and shoving post-race. And while Horner has made it clear that he does not in any way condone the physical nature of Verstappen's behaviour in the FIA garage on Sunday, the Red Bull boss can understand why the youngster was left frustrated with his long-term rival, having missed out on a second successive Grand Prix victory. ""Of course we don't condone violence, but you have to understand that emotions are running very high,"" said Horner, who saw his driver bring home his damaged RB14 in second. ""There's a lot of history between those two drivers that goes right back to karting. What we don't know is what words were said between them and how he was antagonised."

This a filler sentence with some spppppecial words in it, to be found in multiple articles. In fact, the American squad's recent form has been so good that they haven't failed to get both cars out of Q1 since… Mexico 2017. Yes, there's something about the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez that Haas' cars do not like, with no Haas driver having ever managed to reach Q2 here in the team's three-season history. And after another disappointing Saturday in Mexico, both Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen were left mystified as to where their recent performance had disappeared to. Having failed to set a single top 10 time throughout any of the three practice sessions on Friday and Saturday, Haas chucked everything they could at their cars to try and help the drivers escape Q1, using up three brand new sets of the stickiest hypersoft tyres to try and overcome their pace deficit. Nothing worked, however, Grosjean ending up in P16 – albeit that the Frenchman was just 0.083s shy of Pierre Gasly's P15 time – while a more obviously discombobulated Kevin Magnussen, who missed much of FP3 this morning after his intercooler was changed, was a further 0.688s back from his team mate in P18. ""We're just not making the tyres work,"" was Magnussen's assessment of the team's performance in Mexico. ""Every time you go on track with a new set of tyres, it's a completely different car. It just changes the balance completely and makes it impossible to do a lap, especially as this morning I didn't get any running and you're just on the back foot.

https://cluster-4-unique.formula1.com/en/latest/article.'everyone-thinks-me-and-max-hate-each-other-and-thats-absolutely-not-the.o4eIErvfjMCIuwsSiuw8o.html,"If you believe the rumours, you'd think that Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz's time together at Toro Rosso was an all-out war, complete with racing dads who despised each other, bitter in-fighting and a final vicious coup that allowed Verstappen, and not Sainz, to replace Daniil Kvyat at Red Bull. But according to Sainz, the simple, boring truth is that, in reality, there's zero beef between their pair. Sainz and Verstappen both stepped up to Formula 1 with Toro Rosso in 2015. And while the relationship between the two young guns certainly had its flash points on track – Verstappen refusing to swap places at Singapore 2015, for instance, or the Dutchman rear-ending Sainz in Australia in 2016 – Sainz maintains that rumours of animosity between them have been overblown to a proportion that he doesn't quite understand. ""It's one of the enigmas of the paddock,"" says the Spaniard of the supposed rivalry. ""Everyone thinks me and Max hate each other, and that's absolutely not the case. Many fans, when I go to autograph signings, they keep asking me about Max, and 'What's the relationship?' Even my friends keep asking me about Max and the relationship we had. ""We were having fun that year, I promise. We had a lot of fun out of the track. In the track, we were extremely competitive. We knew we were battling for our careers, for our Formula 1 pedigree in our first year, rookie season, and I got on with him a lot better than what people think.""  Incidents like this one at the 2016 Australian Grand Prix got the rumour mill spinning Speaking to Tom Clarkson on the official F1 podcast, Beyond The Grid, presented by Bose, Sainz is unequivocal about his former team mate's talent behind the wheel, even admitting that it pushed him to take his own game to new heights. But he also concedes that it still hurt when, in 2016, Verstappen got the nod from Dr Helmut Marko to replace the struggling Kvyat in the senior Red Bull team. ""For me, Max, there's no doubt that he's one of the most talented, if not the most talented guys that I've battled against in Formula 1,"" says Sainz. ""So I really enjoyed that year because it also forced me to take another step. I thought I was extremely good after 2014, after the year I did, then I arrived in Formula 1 and I'm up against a young guy with a lot of talent, so it made me do another step of commitment, of professionalism, of talent, of everything. So it made me a better driver in the end. ""It was a big blow [when Max got promoted to Red Bull at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix]. I always had in mind that Red Bull really wanted the 'Max Verstappen phenomenon' to go to Red Bull as soon as possible. And I always thought that he obviously deserved it. But I also felt that I deserved it at the same time, because I felt I was not getting outperformed or beaten that often for there to be a very clear cut between him and me."" Fortunately for Sainz, however, revenge for being passed over came along pretty quickly. ""I remember that exact weekend, [Max] won the race, but at the same time, I was starting ninth and after lap one, I was P3, right behind him, in a Toro Rosso! And that really felt good. [Daniel] Ricciardo was leading after lap one when the two Mercedes crashed, then it was Max and then it was me. And I was like, 'Hey, here I am Helmut [Marko, Red Bull Motorsport Advisor] with the Toro Rosso, still P3 behind Max like in the Toro Rosso days, so I'm going for it'."" 2019 will see Sainz move away from the Red Bull company for the first time in his F1 career, when he transfers from the Renault team that Red Bull loaned him to in 2017 to take on the role of team leader at McLaren. That decision was, in part, determined by Red Bull's decision to promote Pierre Gasly from Toro Rosso to take the place of the departing Ricciardo, rather than pulling Sainz back from Renault. But did Sainz think he was ever really in the running to get the Red Bull drive? ""I think so, yeah,"" he says. ""I think Red Bull considered it, of course. ""[But] I thought, 'The most likely thing is that they end up getting Pierre, so I'm going to start looking for other options'. What is true is that the moment I left Toro Rosso to go to Renault, I knew I was losing chances to go to Red Bull. It was part of my decision, of the thinking process of, 'I don't want to do a fourth year with Toro Rosso', I want to go to Renault – because Renault was interested in me at the time – and I know that if I go to Renault and there is a space at Red Bull in a year or two's time, I'm losing credits to go there because I'm abandoning the family, in a way. ""But in the end, I'm convinced it turned out to be a good decision for myself, and I'm very happy to go, to have gone to Renault first and to have an opportunity to drive for McLaren next year."" Sainz also uses his episode of Beyond The Grid to quash one more rumour – that Verstappen had a hand in blocking Sainz from getting the Red Bull drive. And while the Spaniard can't be sure that those conversations didn't go on, he's dubious about whether Verstappen would have – or could have – exercised such a veto. ""It is a very difficult question,"" says Sainz. ""You could ask him, but I think that we got on well. We had our rivalry of course, but I wouldn't think he'd go to Helmut or Christian [Horner, Red Bull Team Principal] and say, 'No, I don't want Carlos'. First of all because, the moment you say that, you sound weak… And second, I don't think he ever really said that."""

Here are 10 records that were broken in 2019. Lewis Hamilton scored 413 points this season – five more than in 2018 when he secured his fifth championship. Yes, he was helped by points for fastest lap, a rule introduced for the 2019 season, but this is still Hamilton's highest-ever tally and the biggest haul ever recorded by a driver, underlining the six-time champ's consistency and dominance. Lewis also broke the record for the longest gap between first and last championships. Michael Schumacher went 10 years between his first and his seventh, there are 11 between Lewis' first in 2008 and his latest triumph. READ MORE: Could Ferrari sign Hamilton for 2021? Ferrari and Mercedes duelled throughout the season for this one, but with 65 front-row lockouts, Ferrari now hold the outright record by just one. Much of that was down to their impressive qualifying form after the summer break, and their one-two Saturday showing in Japan edged them ahead of the Silver Arrows. Behind Mercedes in the all-time list are McLaren and Williams, who have 62 front-row lockouts each. Expect this battle to continue in 2020 when the record could change hands a number of times.

But before that, we have a season in prospect that's set to be an absolute corker. Here's 10 reasons why… The rule shake-up for 2021 will almost inevitably mean that a driver from the team that gets on top of the new regulations quickest will come out on top that season. But in 2020, with the cars likely to be subtle evolutions of their 2019 predecessors, what we should have in store instead is a delicious, driver-focused scrap for the championship – with a host of genuine contenders. READ MORE: What F1 in 2019 can tell us about 2020 All three of Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull showed in the latter half of 2019 that they could win races, with five out of the six drivers from those teams taking victories in that period. So… a Max Verstappen title tilt in 2020? Charles Leclerc's first championship bid? Valtteri Bottas 2.77? Title #5 for Car #5 (Sebastian Vettel)? All are possible this season, as Lewis Hamilton's rivals look to spoil his party in 2020.  Will Verstappen and Leclerc be duking it out for title honours in 2020? Oh, we love a good bit of silly seasoning. But while 2019's game of musical chairs didn't quite pop off in the way we might have hoped, 2020's could be absolutely choice. Sebastian Vettel's contract is up at the end of the season at Ferrari. So too is Max Verstappen's at Red Bull, as well as both Hamilton's and Bottas' at Mercedes. In fact, the futures of just three drivers – Esteban Ocon, Charles Leclerc and Sergio Perez – are set in stone beyond the end of 2020. The arrival of the 2021 regulations, then, could bring some potentially fascinating driver changes with them as well. READ MORE: The Big Quiz of 2019 By now, we're used to seeing Lewis Hamilton bashing through records like Miley Cyrus' proverbial wrecking ball. But 2020 could see him take two doozies that would statistically cement his reputation as one of the best of all time. Michael Schumacher's key career stats stand at 91 wins and seven titles. Championship-wise, Hamilton would match the German if he takes the title this year – while should Hamilton, with 84 Grand Prix triumphs to his name as of Abu Dhabi 2019, win at least eight times in 2020 (as he has done every season since 2014), he'll trump Schumacher's victory record. With Hamilton already F1's King of Qualifying (his Abu Dhabi 2019 pole was his 88th, while Schumacher took 68 in his career), the Briton seems poised to become the sport's records overlord in 2020.

The inaugural Vietnam Grand Prix will be especially exciting, given that the Hanoi Circuit is the first ever track that Formula 1 itself has been instrumental in designing. The 5.6km circuit will feature a 1.5km straight, as well as sections deliberately designed to ape the best bits of other great circuits, to create what should be a proper drivers' track, in one of Southeast Asia's most vibrant and storied cities.

The 31st Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort – a track F1 last raced at in 1985 – will see home hero Max Verstappen and co. do battle on the fast and flowing circuit, which has had a spritzing of modernisation to accommodate F1's fearsome modern machinery. That includes banking both the Hugenholtz and Arie Luyendijk corners, the latter allowing the cars to slingshot their way onto the main start-finish straight with a rapidity that will make your head spin.

Ultimately, it would take a year on the sidelines as Mercedes' reserve driver in 2019 before Ocon could return to frontline F1 driving with Renault for 2020.

The Mercedes man's effort was, by his own admission (and it was an assessment pretty much universally shared), 'magic' – but it also showed the startling rate of progress in F1. Since Sebastian Vettel took pole at Marina Bay last September, F1 cars have been given a radical overhaul with the addition of the halo, which has added to the overall weight of the car. However, all the cars fighting for pole this year did so on Pirelli's quickest ever tyres – the hypersofts – which will have provided a significant performance boost compared to last year's ultrasofts. But even without that, Hamilton's lap – and those of those of the rest of the field – was a startling reminder of the incredible rate of progress the teams have made from a chassis, aerodynamic and power unit point of view over the last year."
https://cluster-8-unique.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alfa-romeo-rue-disappointing-monaco-compromised-by-qualifying.4ZNb2wMHp75bE6Y1dHfQKe.html,"Things got worse for Giovinazzi at the start when he lost a place to Robert Kubica and grew frustrated behind the slower Williams, eventually trying a move at Rascasse that failed and tipped the Pole into a spin. Raikkonen didn't fare much better, incurring front wing damage on lap one, clashing with Lance Stroll and then getting stuck in a train of cars as he ultimately ended up 17th, two places clear of Giovinazzi. But they couldn't repeat that speed in qualifying, with Raikkonen starting 14th and Giovinazzi 18th – having incurred a three-place grid penalty for impeding during the one-hour shoot-out. The Grand Prix weekend, Kimi Raikkonen's 300th no less, was building nicely for the Italian team, with Antonio Giovinazzi looking particularly quick as he went sixth fastest in Saturday morning practice. Alfa Romeo looked pretty strong across all three practice sessions in Monaco, but then their pace deserted them in qualifying and that ultimately ended all hopes of points in Sunday's race… ""We need to check [where the pace went] as yesterday until qualifying, the car was really strong,"" said Giovinazzi. ""Then in qualifying, we didn't understand what happened. It's impossible to say if we were good or not [in the race], as I was stuck behind a Williams."" Raikkonen added: ""I don't think we had the speed to get to the points, unless something really big happened to the guys in front that was it. I didn't expect it to be a very easy weekend. If you look at it there were some points in which it was a bit better, but not many. It was always going to be difficult and it was what we expected, but it's far from ideal."" Team Principal Frederic Vasseur reckons Alfa Romeo did have good performance, but they were simply unable to show it because of track position. ""It was a difficult weekend for us and our race was effectively compromised on Saturday,"" he said. ""At some stages, our cars were among the fastest on track, but Monaco being Monaco it meant there was no way to make up any ground. ""Leaving with no points after the promise we had shown in practice is disappointing, but hopefully we can get back to scoring ways next time around in Canada."" Alfa Romeo have dropped to ninth in the constructors' championship on 13 points, ahead of only Williams but just 17 behind McLaren in fourth place."
https://cluster-9-unique.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-ready-if-melbourne-were-tomorrow.3LDbIwHblucacEE4OIKA48.html,"McLaren suffered a second consecutive day of limited running due to reliability issues, with Alonso stopping on track after 47 laps due to an oil leak. Ten further laps were possible right at the end of the day, but their final tally was Wednesday's lowest and leaves them with the least mileage covered out of all ten teams so far. Despite sitting bottom of the charts in terms of laps completed in pre-season testing so far, McLaren would have no major problems racing if 2018's first race in Australia were tomorrow, according to Fernando Alonso. In terms of fundamental answers that we need over the winter test, they are already okay and we have all of them Asked if he will be ready for Australia with just one more day in the car during testing, Alonso replied: ""Yeah, I think so. ""Actually we probably need the last day to do some laps, some long runs, to check extra things that you always discover about the new car, but in terms of fundamental answers that we need over the winter test, they are already okay and we have all of them. So I don't need the last day to be honest. ""I will be in the car, I will drive – hopefully we will keep discovering new things on the car – but if Australia was tomorrow it's okay."" With Wednesday's opening two hours proving particularly productive as Alonso completed 47 laps and posted a 1m 19.856s on the hypersoft tyre, the Spaniard downplayed the impact of the oil leak that saw his MCL33 confined to the garage until the final 15 minutes of the day. ""Definitely we would like to do a few more laps today. The problem was a little bit longer obviously that [McLaren only did] 50 laps, but at the end of the day we discovered things – yesterday with Stoffel (Vandoorne) and today with myself. But this is part of testing and hopefully these things won't happen in lap 10 in Melbourne. ""So in a way I'm happy to keep making the car stronger and stronger. All the important parts and all the important things in the programme we managed to do in the morning, so the rest of the day was going to be about long runs and putting laps on the car but we did not need any information at that time. So I am not too stressed about the laps we lost today."" With team boss Eric Boullier calling for patience with the new McLaren-Renault partnership earlier on Wednesday, Alonso points to his experience as the reason he is so calm with two days of testing to run. ""I think this is more or less normal in every new car, maybe you are new to this, but I am 18 years in and in winter testing I keep discovering things every year. It is the same not only in winter testing but before when testing was free we would test in between races like before Monaco and Canada going to Paul Ricard and doing 20 laps a day and there was no coverage. ""Now I understand we have hundreds of media so every red flag attracts a lot of attention but from a team point of view we are more or less okay and there is nothing fundamentally a problem with the car and the issues we had are well under control, but unfortunately we keep discovering small things every day. ""That is putting us in a strong position for Australia in the way we can enforce these small issues. As I said before it is better it happen here than in two weeks' time."""

When Hamilton picked it up in the next two races, Bottas did close to the next best possible result, with second and third. At Silverstone last weekend, he would have been second, too, had it not been for a deflating tyre. He is delivering 100% of what Mercedes need from him. READ MORE: A closer look at how strategy and cornering speeds played their part in the dramatic Silverstone finale The Finn has been integral to their successive constructors' championships, gets on well with Hamilton by being competitive and offering a threat but not riling him up and getting under his skin, and mostly delivers when required. Ultimately, then, signing Bottas for another season – on the assumption Hamilton will also renew – is a no brainer.  Austrian Grand Prix 2020: Bottas wins opening round of F1 season That has been Mercedes' style with Bottas' contracts since he joined in 2017. The Finn will be used to it, having had one-year deals from the moment he signed on the dotted line to race for Williams in 2013. It's not ideal, of course, and Bottas pushed for a longer-term deal. But he knew that if all that was offered was a one-year extension, with an option team-side to extend for 2022, he had to take it – they do, after all, have the best car in Formula 1, and that'll almost certainly be the case next year as well. And as is natural, there was some discussion over salary, with Bottas having admitted that Wolff can ""be a pain in the ass"" sometimes ""when you speak about contract numbers"". READ MORE: FORM GUIDE: Can Mercedes make it five wins out of five at the 70th Anniversary GP? For Mercedes, they keep Bottas motivated as a one-year deal means he needs to keep delivering if he is to retain his seat. He cannot afford to have any low periods of form. With this arrangement, the Silver Arrows have flexibility with that second seat, meaning they can keep Bottas again for 2022 if he keeps delivering the goods or let him go and make way for George Russell, who they rate highly, or Esteban Ocon – both of whom belong to the Mercedes stable of junior drivers. Not really. Wolff has always asserted that his priority was to keep Hamilton and Bottas, and given the way they have worked together and had a seamless relationship that has been the polar opposite of Hamilton-Nico Rosberg, it's not a surprise.

Of course, there were discussions with Russell, to assure him that he remains part of their plans in the future, and Wolff was very respectful of Vettel – admitting earlier this year that Mercedes needed to consider a swoop for the four-time world champion – when the German was linked to the seat, but the reality was that retaining the status quo was always the goal. Hamilton is a focal part of Mercedes, and thus Wolff and the management will always listen to his opinion, but the reality is he won't have had any sway in the decision as to who filled the second seat, not least because he has yet to commit to the team himself. Mercedes have a good thing going right now and they will know that Hamilton gets on well with Bottas, and performs at his highest level without disruption when they are a pairing, so that will have figured in their thinking.

The reigning world champion's contract is more complicated, perhaps the most complicated on the grid, given he has various personal deals and demands on his time outside of the track. Hamilton said last weekend that the Covid lockdown gave him a renewed energy to perhaps go longer in Formula 1, adding he is aiming to race on in F1 for at least three more years. READ MORE: DATA ANALYSIS: How impressive was Hamilton's performance on three wheels? Unlike Bottas, he won't be discussing a one-year deal, but something longer-term, most likely for that period of time, which will take him up to the end of 2023, which, incidentally, is when Max Verstappen's arrangement with Red Bull expires. It seems that there haven't been any proper talks yet between Mercedes and Hamilton, but both sides are very relaxed about it. The feeling is they just haven't had the time to sit down and discuss the contract – and when they do, while there is plenty to talk about, it seems to be a question of when, not if."

But, as Wolff revealed, Bottas now knows he's got to come out of the blocks quickly in 2019 to avoid the same fate. Having won three times in his first season with Mercedes last year, Bottas remains victory-less in 2018. A crash in qualifying for Australia appeared to set the tone for what's been an often frustrating year of mistakes, technical failures, team orders and occasionally anonymous performances from the Finn as his team mate Lewis Hamilton has soared. That led to Bottas being a full 110 points off Hamilton heading into the Russian Grand Prix weekend. He was hooked up around the Sochi Autodrom, snatching an impressive pole position as Hamilton faltered – and he would have converted that into his first win of the year had Mercedes not moved Hamilton ahead mid-race. And while it may have been frustrating for Bottas, according to Wolff he is well aware of what he needs to do to prevent being in the same boat in 12 months' time. ""In Sochi we sat down right after the race,"" said Wolff, ""and [Valtteri] said, 'We don't need to discuss anything. If I was in your shoes… I would do exactly the same. I comprehend that I need to perform better at the beginning of the season to put myself in a situation that I can actually go for the championship title and I haven't done that, so I respect your calls.'"" Bottas starting well next year will be doubly important following the news that George Russell will drive for Williams in 2019 in place of Lance Stroll, who in turn is expected to be confirmed in Esteban Ocon's seat at Force India. That will likely mean Ocon is forced into a year on the sidelines, most likely in the Mercedes third driver role that Russell has occupied in 2018. So with Ocon waiting in the wings – and with Wolff recently stating his belief that the Frenchman will one day be a world champion for Mercedes – Bottas will need to show his credentials as a title contender from the get-go in 2019 if he's to keep favour with his Silver Arrows bosses."

That tussle ultimately lost the Dutchman the race, allowing Lewis Hamilton to regain the lead and secure victory for Mercedes. And while Horner has made it clear that he does not in any way condone the physical nature of Verstappen's behaviour in the FIA garage on Sunday, the Red Bull boss can understand why the youngster was left frustrated with his long-term rival, having missed out on a second successive Grand Prix victory. ""Of course we don't condone violence, but you have to understand that emotions are running very high,"" said Horner, who saw his driver bring home his damaged RB14 in second. ""There's a lot of history between those two drivers that goes right back to karting. What we don't know is what words were said between them and how he was antagonised."
